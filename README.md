# Homework 11: Note Take


## Description

I created a note-taking application with the below functionality:

* Upon opening the application, the user is presented with a landing page introducing the application. The user can then click on the "Get Started" link, taking them to a notes page.
* On the notes page, previously saved notes are displayed in the left pane. Clicking on each note will open the note title and text toward the right side of the screen (read-only).
* Upon clicking the "plus" icon, the user can enter a new note title and description and then click the disk icon to save the note. Saving the note will add it to the other saved notes in the left pane.
